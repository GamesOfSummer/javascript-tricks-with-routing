# History of JS

-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh6lK57Cuk4

-   Written in 10 days
-   Tried to use Java, thnought it was a bad idea
-   Flexible multi-papdym language, that developers could mold what they needed
-   Started as Mocha, then Livescript, then Javascript

-   looked down upon since people just wrote pop-up spam with it

-   ecma - European Computer Manufacturers Association, used because Microsoft fragmented with JScript

-   ES3 - introduced '==='
-   ES4 - failed, stalled for ten years

-   2006 - JQuery tried to stanndized everything between all browsers

-   Coffeescript - stated transpiling, important for ES6. It's a verb that means one language to another, same level of abstraaction. C# goes to binary, TS goes to JS

# JS Bootcamp

-   Var IS BAD, do NOT USE IT. It has global scope. Use `let` and `const` only. Start with const unless you know you'll reassign it.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
